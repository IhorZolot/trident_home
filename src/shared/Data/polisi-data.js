export const privacyPolicy = `A privacy policy is a legal document that discloses the ways a business gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a customer's data. Its purpose is to inform individuals such as website visitors and customers on what types of personal information is gathered by your site or mobile app, how it is used and disclosed, how it is protected, and what rights an individual may have in relation to their information.
If you collect personal information from your website visitors, you're likely required by law to have a privacy policy posted to your website (and your mobile app, if you have one).

Aside from the legal requirements, a clear, up to date, and easily accessible privacy policy can be an important part of fostering trust and transparency between you, your customers and website visitors.`
