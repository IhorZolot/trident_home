						Building a garden house is an affordable alternative to moving house or building an extension. A garden room
						also offers you the opportunity to have an art studio, a gym, a meditation space, a yoga practice area, or
						place to entertain and relax with family and friends. We can design and build the perfect garden room to
						entertain, all year round. It can include decked area, a space for a hot tub, a barbeque area, even a
						mini-kitchen. If you have limited space, we can design a summer house perfect for a smaller garden.
